This project is the Chaucer Vertical 3D Printer. The design file collection is not yet complete. The original files were written by a CAD tool that I no longer have access to, so I am porting everything to OpenSCAD. Most of the original parts required hand tooling, so they will be updated as time permits.

Some OpenSCAD design files use the following libraries:

* Write.scad by Roland Hieber at https://github.com/rohieb/Write.scad
* ruler.scad by James Brown at https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:30769
